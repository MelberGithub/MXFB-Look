# MXFB-Look-Library

#### Look Library is an app to save and restore look settings in MX-Linux Fluxbox
This is not a fully tested script. **Use at your own risk!** I suggest creating a new user for testing, in case something goes really wrong.

A look is comprised of the following elements
- gtk theme
- gtk icon theme
- fluxbox style
- tint2 panel (max. two)
- rofi
- wallpaper
- conky (max. one)


Three looks are created by default for testing purposes
- MXFB-default
- test
- test2

You can save further looks...
